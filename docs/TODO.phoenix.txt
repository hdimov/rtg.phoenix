(o) notes from original list, concerning rtg poll-er;

...

2. Make rtgpoll fork and detach like a real grown-up daemon.

3. Support syslog logging.

...

12. Need to add more graceful recovery from failed/restarted pollers.
Currently a poller that is restarted will look like a drop in
traffic for the period of time the poller was down.

13. Develop Linux RPMs.

(o) phoenix revision of tasks.

(~) disable mysql/mariadb integration for now; consider more than one db backend at time and db backedn recovery;

(~) [ info|error|debug] messages. also a good thing will be timestamp logging (when not logging to syslog);

(-) enable syslog inegration;
(-) fork/exec* and .pid managment; enable systemd integration;

(-) while rtgpoll main loop is quite clear, things inside rtgsnmp (poller2) can become quite complicated, specially when
    there are a lot timeout responses

    consider typical small router with about 100 counters inside targets.conf
    rtgpoll configured with 10 threads
    router is not visible for the polling machine;
    rtg poll interval is 30 seconds;
    timeout arrives after ~6s
    rtg will need about a minute to walk through all these counters;
    so every 2nd poll will be lost, not only for those 100 counters, but for all counters inside targets conf at all;
